## Projects

### Unsupervised Learning with Python: Development of an unsupervised learning model to analyze financial parameters of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks at Trade&Ahead. PCA, Hierarchical Clustering. 
[Publication](https://eportfolio.mygreatlearning.com/heylin-cristina-parra-calder-n) 

Using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering, the project aims to identify hidden patterns and group stocks based on their financial attributes.
Developed a clustering model to group stocks based on financial attributes, enhancing portfolio diversification strategies.
Implemented K-means clustering to segment stocks into distinct categories, achieving clear differentiation between groups.
Created detailed visualizations to illustrate cluster characteristics, aiding in investment strategy formulation.
Applied feature scaling and dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize model performance and improve analysis accuracy.

### Supervised Learning with Python: Development a machine learning-based solution to recommend suitable profiles for visa applicants managed by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).
[Publication](https://eportfolio.mygreatlearning.com/heylin-cristina-parra-calder-n) 

The objective was to develop a predictive model to recommend whether a visa should be approved or denied, based on key factors. Supervised machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting were used.
To improve accuracy, ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost were implemented. Techniques such as feature engineering, regularization, and cross-validation were applied to fine-tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters. 
This system suggests whether a visa should be certified or denied, aligning the recommendations with the most critical factors identified during the data analysis phase.
